:romania: Un cutremur în București nu este o situație ipotetică. Este o certitudine că acest lucru se va întâmpla. În
acest context, la mai bine de 40 de ani de la cutremurul din 1977, memoria colectivă a ascuns în profunzime amintirile
acelui dezastru în încercarea de a-și înăbuși teama. Dar realitatea este că, patru decenii mai târziu, Bucureștiul, la
fel ca restul orașelor cu risc seismic ridicat, nu ar face față unui asemenea eveniment, iar pierderile de vieți
omenești ar fi uriașe.
[Exercițiul Seism 2018](https://www.news.ro/social/exercitiul-seism-2018-cel-mai-recent-bilant-al-cutremurului-simulat-indica-peste-3-900-de-morti-peste-7-000-de-raniti-si-peste-2-300-de-persoane-disparute-1922405315222018102018579831)
derulat de DSU arată că cel puţin 4.587 persoane şi-ar pierde viaţa, iar 8.585 ar fost rănite, 6 spitale vor fi
distruse, 23 de unităţi spitaliceşti distruse parţial, iar 9 avariate, dar funcţionale. O estimare, am spune noi, destul
de optimistă.

Ce putem face pentru a deveni mai puțin vulnerabili? Să știm totul despre oraș, despre clădirile în care locuim astfel
încât să putem cere consolidarea lor. Bulina Roșie nu este doar "un nou site de informare", ci o platformă care
colectează și validează apoi cu experți date despre clădirile din România, la nivel național, ajută asociațiile de
proprietari să își consolideze clădirile, te ține la curent cu legislația și ți-o explică și are grijă să ai la îndemână
informații utile la orice moment.

:gb: An earthquake in Bucharest is not a hypothetical situation. It is certain that this will happen. In this context,
after more than 40 years from the 1977 earthquake, the collective memory has hidden deep the memories of that disaster
in its attempt of stifling its fear. The reality is that, four decades later, Bucharest, as well as the rest of the
cities with a high seismic risk, would not stand up tu such an event, and the loss of life would be tremendous.
[The Earthquake 2018 Exercise](https://www.romania-insider.com/seism-2018-exercise-bucharest) conducted by the DSU shows
that at least 4,587 people would have died and 8,585 would have been injured, 6 hospitals would be destroyed, 23 more
would be partially destroyed, and 9 would be damaged, though still functional. An estimation that we would consider
quite optimistic.

What can we do to become less vulnerable? Find out everything about the city, about the buildings in which we live so
that we can ask for their consolidation. Bulina Roșie is not just "a new information site", but a platform that collects
and then validates with the help of experts data about the buildings in Romania, at a national level, it helps owners
associations to consolidate their buildings, it keeps you in touch with the current legislation and explains it to you,
and it makes sure that you have useful information at your disposal at all times.

**Let's save lives together.**

## Built With

### Programming languages

[Python 3](https://www.python.org)
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

### Frameworks

**API:** [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
**Client:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### Package managers

**API:** [pip](https://pypi.org/)
**Client:** [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Code styling

**API:** [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
**Client:** [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) + [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) + [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

### Database technology & provider

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)

## Getting started

Risc Seismic API is a Django application, built on top of Python 3.9+ with a PostgreSQL database. The Client is a React
single page application.

### Pre-requisites

In order to run the project locally, you need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) installed.

You can install the above-mentioned packages manually, or you can use our helper commands.

On `Ubuntu` run:

```shell
make install-docker-ubuntu
```

On `MacOS` run:

```shell
make install-docker-osx
```

On other platforms please follow the instructions described here:

- <https://docs.docker.com/install/>
- <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

### Initial set-up

#### Initialising all the services

Make sure to check the [Environment variables](#environment-variables)
section for info on how to set up the keys before you run the following commands:

```shell
cp .env.dev .env
# build the development container
make build-dev
```

If you didn't set up the `RUN_LOAD_DUMMY_DATA` variable, you can add dummy data to the database with the following command:

```shell
make init-db
```

If the `RUN_LOAD_DUMMY_DATA` was `yes`, then you should have dummy data but will have to create a superuser:

```shell
docker-compose exec api ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### Backing up and restoring the database in case of an upgrade

1. Create a back-up of the data
   (the `build` folder is ignored by git)

    ```shell
    docker-compose exec db pg_dumpall -U postgres > ./build/backup.sql
    ```

2. Run the database upgrade or just get the latest version of the code from git if it upgrades the database

    ```shell
    git pull upstream develop
    ```

3. Remove the current database and start-up the environment
   (remove the `-dev` part if you don't want the development mode)

    ```shell
    make drop-db && make build-dev
    ```

4. Restore the backed-up data to the new database

    ```shell
    docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres < ./build/backup.sql
    ```

5. Check the API endpoints and that you can log in the admin interface with the same users as before

### Environment variables

#### Deployment variables

The following variables change the way the API is deployed.

`RUN_MIGRATION`
Run the initial migrations (sets up the data models from the database).

`RUN_LOAD_DUMMY_DATA`
Adds real & dummy data to the database (adds buildings, blog posts, pages, datafiles, and statistics).

`RUN_COLLECT_STATIC`
Collects static files so that they can be easily served to production.

`RUN_DEV_SERVER`
Runs the application in the development mode.

#### External services API keys

In order to have a fully functional project, you have to get two API keys: HERE Maps API Key and hCAPTCHA API Key.

##### HERE Maps API Key

Tutorial: [https://developer.here.com/tutorials/getting-here-credentials/](https://developer.here.com/tutorials/getting-here-credentials/)

Keys added to the `.env` file:

```shell
# the same key can be used for both variables
HERE_MAPS_API_KEY
REACT_APP_HERE_MAPS_API_KEY
```

##### hCAPTCHA API Key

1. [Create a hCAPTCHA account](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/signup)
2. Go to [your settings page](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/settings)
3. Create a New Site, copy the Site Key and add it to the environment variables list

Keys added to the `.env` file:

```shell
REACT_APP_CAPTCHA_API_KEY
```

### Starting the project

First check the `.env` file created by the init command and see if there are any environment variables that you might
need to provide or change. This file is used by `docker-compose` to pass the environment variables to the container it
creates.

Get the project up and running:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to access the local environment site and admin at the following URLs:

- <http://localhost:8030/api/v1/>
- <http://localhost:8030/admin/>

If you have problems starting the project, first check out
the [FAQ](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc/wiki/FAQ) and if that doesn't work, ask someone from the
project's channel. Maybe the issue you just had is worth adding to
the [FAQ](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc/wiki/FAQ), wouldn't it?

To work on running containers that were started using `docker-compose up`, open another terminal and:

```shell
cd path/to/repo
docker-compose exec api some_container_command
# or
docker-compose exec client some_container_command
```

In order to see all available commands, run:

```shell
make help
```

### Starting the project without docker

#### Windows platform

##### Prerequisites

1. [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-tutorial-resources-training?cid=55)
2. [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/)
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.16.0/node-v14.16.0-x64.msi)

##### Steps to set your environment

1. In project directory run:

    ```shell
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    pip install -r ./api/requirements-dev.txt
    copy .env.dev .env
    ```

2. Check the .env file created by the copy command and see if there are any environment variables that you might need to
   provide or change. Double check database config line in .env. It has to follow this
   pattern: `postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME`

3. Run following in order to set the needed environment variables:

    ```shell
    activate_dev_env.bat
    ```

4. Check database connection. If this fails double check database configuration.

    ```shell
    python api/wait_for_db.py
    ```

5. Run migrations:

    ```shell
    python api/manage.py migrate --no-input
    ```

6. Create admin user (user to login into admin pannel):

    ```shell
    python api/manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. Load dummy data in database:

    ```shell
    python api/manage.py loaddata statistics
    python api/manage.py loaddata buildings
    python api/manage.py loaddata pages
    ```

8. Install node modules.

    ```shell
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

#### Steps needed to start development servers

*1. Start API server.*

Open terminal in the project directory and run environment activation script, then start the server.

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
activate_dev_env.bat
python api\manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8030
```

Check functionality at http://localhost:8030 you should get a 404 page.

*2. Start front-end server.*

Open terminal in the project directory and run environment activation script, then start the server.

```shell
activate_dev_env.bat
cd client
npm start
```

Check functionality at http://localhost:3000.

### Development

When creating new models in Django, in order to make sure they are generated in a clean environment, it is recommended
to generate the migration files using the `make` command:

```shell
make makemigrations && make migrate
```

When you need to add/remove requirements or restrict the version of a requirement, edit the `requirements.in` (prod) and
the `requirements-dev.in` (dev) files accordingly. After doing this run:

```shell
make update-requirements
```

This will create a clean environment where it uses the [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/) library to
compile the corresponding `requirements.txt` files with the versions of the packages pinned. This is important as it
guarantees that every environment this service runs in, has the same dependencies installed and minimizes the risk
of `works on my machine`.

### Known Issues

#### Client hot-reload on Windows Docker is not working

Try following these steps:

1. open up a terminal in **seismic-risc_client** container
2. `cd ./node_modules/react-scripts/config/`
3. `vi webpackDevServer.config.js`
4. on the exported config object, update the value of `watchOptions` to include the following properties:

    ```shell
    aggregateTimeout: 100,
    poll: 500
    ```

5. save the file and restart the client container

This way, webpack-dev-server should be watching files in polling mode, instead of listening for file change events.

#### In VS Code, ESLint fails to load the Prettier plugin

Add the following option to user settings in VS Code if ESLint fails to load the Prettier plugin.

```json
{
    "eslint.workingDirectories": [
        {
            "mode": "auto"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Management Commands

The new custom command can be called using
`python manage.py buildings <number>`
required arguments:

- --delete
- --create

```shell
cd path/to/repo
docker-compose exec api bash
root@ba4fd81f9023:/code# python manage.py buildings 30 --create
100% |███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 30/30 [00:00<00:00, 37.89it/s]
Successfully created 30 buildings.
root@ba4fd81f9023:/code# python manage.py buildings 25 --delete
Successfully deleted 25 buildings.
```

## Testing

Local development testing:

```shell
cd path/to/repo
docker-compose exec api bash
root@3c5df91778ad:/code# pytest
```

Pipeline testing:

```shell
make test
```

## Production

In order to get the container ready for production use, we need to first build it:

```shell
docker build -t seismic-risc:latest ./api
```

Use the `prod.env.dist` template file and create a `prod.env` file with the correct environment variables and run like
so:

```shell
docker run --env-file prod.env -p HOST_PORT:GUNICORN_PORT seismic-risc:latest
```

Or, you can provide all the environment variables at runtime:

```shell
docker run -e DJANGO_CONFIGURATION=Prod -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY= -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME -e GUNICORN_PORT=5000 -e GUNICORN_WORKERS=2 -p HOST_PORT:GUNICORN_PORT seismic-risc:latest
```

After testing the container runs properly, tag and upload the self to Docker hub:

```shell
docker tag seismic-risc:latest code4romania/seismic-risc:latest
docker push code4romania/seismic-risc:latest
```
