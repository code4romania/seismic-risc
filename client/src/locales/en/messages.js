VotONG is, therefore, the necessary piece of infrastructure for the self-regulation of the NGO sector in Romania, which in time, through the active participation of organizations, will lead to an efficient communication and consultation between all actors in the field. That is why we invite you to join us in this endeavor because together we can trigger the positive changes we want for the Romanian society. Together we are invincible. Both us and our beneficiaries.
